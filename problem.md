### Temelio Solutions Engineer Take Home Test

This test is designed to test how you can parse JSON data into a structured format. You are given a JSON file called submissions.json that contains a list of submissions. These submissions are applications from grantees in our system. In our industry, foundations and grantmakers receive applications from grantees and need to parse the data into a structured format to analyze and make decisions.

### Instructions

You will need to write a script to parse each submission response and store it as a row in the submission_output.csv file with the corresponding columns defined. I have shown an example of the first row JSON data parsed in the correct columns. Note that only the columns in the example are required.

#### Submission Details

You will need to submit two files:

- Code file (Python, Java, Javascript, any language of your choice) that performs the parsing and writes the output to a CSV file.
- submission_output.csv file that contains the parsed data from the submissions.json file.

#### Miscellaneous

Please note that I kept the instructions vague on purpose. I want to you to figure out which fields need to be mapped appropriately. If you have any questions or need clarification, please reach out to ruthwick@trytemelio.com
